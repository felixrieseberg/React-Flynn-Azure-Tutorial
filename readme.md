# React Flynn Azure Installer
This is a small tutorial component for the Flynn Azure installer. It has virtually no use outside of the Flynn installer, but if you came to check out some code, go ahead!

## Running the Example
Clone the repository from GitHub and open the created folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/felixrieseberg/React-Flynn-Azure-Installer.git
cd React-Flynn-Azure-Installer
```

Install npm packages and compile JSX
```
npm install
grunt
```

If you are using Windows, run the following commands instead:
```
npm install --msvs_version=2013
grunt
```

Open the example in example/index.html.
